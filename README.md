# Foodies App Backend

This is the backend application for
[Foodies App](https://partizanen69.github.io/team-project-foodies-frontend/), a
website for creating and managing recipes. It provides the necessary server-side
functionality to support the frontend application.

## Technologies

- Node.js and Express.js for server-side JavaScript runtime and web framework.
- MongoDB for the database to store recipes, user information, and other data.
- Mongoose as the MongoDB object modeling tool.
- Swagger UI Express for documenting and visualizing the API using Swagger
  documentation.
- Other dependencies such as axios, bcrypt, cloudinary, cors, dotenv, joi,
  jsonwebtoken, morgan, multer, multer-storage-cloudinary, gravatar, nanoid,
  nodemailer, and query-string are used for various functionalities within the
  backend.
